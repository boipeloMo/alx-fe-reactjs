# React Form Handling – Controlled Components & Formik

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates two approaches to handling forms in **React**:

1. **Controlled Components** – Managing form state manually using `useState`.
2. **Formik + Yup** – Simplifying form handling and validation with Formik’s API.

The form simulates a **User Registration** process with fields for:
- Username  
- Email  
- Password  

It includes validation to ensure all fields are filled, and demonstrates how to connect to a mock API.
